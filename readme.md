`main.rs` provides an example using Actix (starts the server).

`lib.rs` will eventually become its own crate.

## Usage
You can use curl or the react front-end to make requests to the server.

To start react, `cd ./react-ui` and then `yarn start`.

For curl, there are a list of commands you can run in `curl.txt`.
